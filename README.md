## Description

Hey there! You have reached the repository for my Portfolio Page.
In this page, I present some of the web applications I have been working and the skills I am developing.
This page is meant to work as a routing page that briefly describes each project and directs you to the deployed pages.
I hope you enjoy it!

To tell you a bit about myself, I have 8 years of local and international experience in transportation planning and engineering, including research and policy formulation. I have taken formal training in ArcMap, Vissim, AutoCAD, Revit and Photoshop. In previous positions, I performed with MS Office, ArcMap, Vissim, Synchro, and Stata. Lately, I have decided to have a transition in my career that allows me to have a better lifestyle. I enjoy the little pleasures in life, having a flexible schedule, working from home and a nice ergonomic chair with a sitting standing desk... and I also enjoy drawing.
