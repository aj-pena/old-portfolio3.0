Use jQuery in Your Portfolio

Enhance your portfolio using jQuery. Can you animate something using the [jQuery animation library](https://api.jquery.com/animate/)? Or you might choose to implement another jQuery functionality that you've learned this week.


Build a Small Application

With your new skills, you may be tempted to incorporate external data in your existing portfolio, like displaying today's weather. But why not take things a step further? Try building a small application that's enticing to prospective employers. For example, you could build a dynamic weather app that uses the browser API to get the user's location, then makes a request to an external API to display the weather. Be sure to push the final page to GitHub, get a live site going, and write a fully formed readme file.
